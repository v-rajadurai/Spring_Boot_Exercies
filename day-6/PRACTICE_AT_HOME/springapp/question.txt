Create folders named as controller, model, repository and service inside the WORKSPACE/springapp/src/main/java.com example /springapp. Inside the controller folder, create a class named "LanguageControIler". 
Inside model folder, create a class named "Language" with the following attributes:
languageld - int
2. languageName - String
3. languageCode - int
4. country - String
Implement getters, setters and constructors for thecorresponding attributes. 

Inside repository folder, create an interface named "LanguageRepo".
Inside service folder, create a class named "LanguageService".

GET - /api/language/sortBy/{field} - Returns response status 200 with List <Language> object, where {field} denotes the attribute name to be sorted in ascending order on successful retrieval or else 404.
